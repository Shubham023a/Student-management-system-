Schools require efficient management of data related to students, teachers, attendance, and fees. Traditional paper-based systems can be error-prone and time-consuming.
This project focuses on automating these tasks by developing a School Management System that is easy to use, scalable, and secure. 
Our project will use C++ programming and file handling techniques to store and retrieve data.
This application is designed to be simple yet effective, capable of handling multiple records and operations.
